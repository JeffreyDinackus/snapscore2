# snapscore2


this project is a way for you to increase your snapscore. 

exponential mode is enabled by default. 

i got 5k in one day from zero. 

you select your groups and send them a snap/ etc to send to, and it might click last snap sent if you have no best friends after running it from the snap screen.


# Don't forget to star the project if it helped you

This project was inspired by the project snapscore by my friend Hassan.

His original project was open source so I will make this version open source too.

It will always snap the top best friend or last snap btw so make sure your top best friend or last snap is the person you want to snap



# Major goals of this project:

Improve readability of the code compared with Hassan's code.

Update the code to be usuable with the current version of snapchat
